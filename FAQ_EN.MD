# What are azw.res files?

Tested with Kindle for PC (Windows), Lightnovels from Amazon Japan are downloaded as two parts, saved in a folder that ends with ```_EBOK```. 

One part has a .azw extension and you can use DRM Tools to decrypt it and get an azw3 file. This one contians most contents of the book and there are many tools to deal with it.

Another part has an azw.res extension and it is not encrypted. The azw.res file contains HD version of the images in the book. 

The total file size of the two parts will be the File Size in the Product details.

Please note that azw.res could only be found with Kindle for PC 1.19 or later. Eariler versions have only azw (it is azw3 after decrypting). After Kindle for PC 1.30, the key is not able to dump currently (following DeDRM_tools). But if you have dumped the key before, you can use it. For convenience, just use Kindle for PC between 1.19~1.29.
